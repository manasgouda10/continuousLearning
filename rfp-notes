During a discussion with BAICI(BlueAcronici) we got to know that we are already implementing couple of projects using Adobe Franklin in Infosys.
Wesco, we already got to know about but is there any other project where we are using Franklin with Adobe Commerce/Magento? 

Do you have any contents around: 
•	write-up on how we design common / reusable components, its lifecycle, our methodology on component design patterns, its architecture, etc.
•	Reference slides where we have reusable components as deliverables. Looking for details like documentation, how sprints to be planned etc...
